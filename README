Socket-Based Life
=================
Socket-Based Life (SBL) is a massively parallel implementation of Conway's
Game of Life.  It doesn't do any useful work at all.  Instead, it's purpose
is simply to test my knowledge of sockets.

The basic idea behind the Game of Life is that there are a number of cells and
that status of each depends of that of its neighbors.  In this
implementation, cells can be either alive or dead and a rule is provided for
deciding how this boolean status should change after each round.
